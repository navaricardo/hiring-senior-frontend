# Via Frontend
This challenge is to evaluate your frontend and software engineering skills. 
Clean code, good architecture, design patterns, comments, etc. Imagine that this code will go into production.
This assignment should take you no more than 4 hours to complete, but any extra polish or features won’t go unnoticed. 
You have a week to finish the challenge, but please let us know if you need more time. 

## The assignment
We would like you to create an invoicing app. The features it should include:
- [ ] View created invoices.
- [ ] Create a new invoice.
- [ ] Add line items to the invoices. Line items must include description, amount and currency.
- [ ] Invoice must show total amount in USD. Connect with the exchange rate API of your preference.

We handle a lot of currency conversions and money transactions on a day-to-day basis, so we will pay close attention to how you handle this. 
No need to code anything for the backend, you can use any client-side storage to store the info. This is not a design role, so there are no specific design requirements, feel free to own it. Although this is not a design position, it is very important that you can translate design files (PSD, Figma, etc.) into code (HTML/CSS). 

#### Extra credit features
- [ ] Create at least one test for your code.
- [ ] Good UX.
- [ ] Highly reusable components.
- [ ] Responsive layout and design is a bonus. Please code that only if you have extra time.

## Requirements

- Vue / React.
- Use a state management library.
- It’s okay to use create-react-app or similar tools.
- It’s okay to use another framework like Nuxt / Next.
